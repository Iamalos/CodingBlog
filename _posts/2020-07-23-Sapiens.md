## Intro

This series of posts is about the book by Yuval Harari - Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. The intention behind the posts is to to be sort of a short resume some ideas and pieces of chapters that I highlihgted during reading and which I personally find interesting. As I am still in the process of reading through the book, I will restrain from judgemental notes until I finish the book. 

## Chapter 1

1. 6 million years BC - last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans
2. 2.5 million years BC - evolution of genus _homo_ in Africa
3. 2 million years BC - evolution of different human species and spread from Africa to Eurasia
4. 500 thousand years BC - neanderthals evolve in Europe and Middle East
5. 200 thousand years BC - _Homo Sapiens_ evolve in North Africa
6. 70 thousand years BC - the cognitive revolution and emergence of fictive language. Sapiens spread from Africa
7. 30 thousand years BC - extinction of neanderthals
