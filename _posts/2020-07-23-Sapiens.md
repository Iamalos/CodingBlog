# Sapiens (Part 1)

This series of posts is about the books by Yuval Harari Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. This is more short resume of chapters that I read and what I personally find interesting. As I am still in the process of reading through the book, I will restrain from judgemental notes untilI finish the book.
